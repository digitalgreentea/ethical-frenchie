Hi! We're James & Renee (and now Bryan!), nice to meet you. We are a small, exclusive French Bulldog breeder located on the East Coast. Our breeding program is focused on extra care, socialization and improving the breed. We aren’t your typical “Mom and Pops breeder” that has been around for 20 years. We are started breeding 3 years ago but expanded our program in 2018. We are responsible, knowledgeable and caring which makes us stand out in the sea of faulty backyard breeders and puppy mills.

<h2>What We Do</h2>

We’re passionate about what we do, but more importantly we understand the frustrations of searching high and low while trying to avoid scams and puppy mills alike. We work diligently to ensure that we are following the best French Bulldog breeding practices and work extra hard to make sure your future family member is healthy & socialized to fit your specific family’s needs. After getting one of our puppies we offer life-time support when it comes to caring and raising your new baby. If something happens you won’t be left alone in the dark – we will assist you, so you can reach out anytime.

<h2>Why We Do It</h2>

We started Ethical Frenchie because of what we saw as a lack of transparency and the proliferation of scam artists taking advantage of people when they are most vulnerable. We also breed to better the breed. Most of our dogs are sold as pet only. We won’t offer full AKC registration on each and every puppy – that’s not a responsible thing to do. We will however offer full breeding rights if a puppy from the litter catches our eye and stands out. Too many people are trying to earn an extra buck by selling their dogs with a full AKC registration to get more money for it. Not all dogs are meant to be bred. Some of them lack the “structure”, others are too small or too big and don’t fall under the “standard” French Bulldog look.

Full AKC will also only be offered to an ethical, in house breeder, that has the same vision of bettering the breed, after being extensively screened by us. We would hate for our dogs to end up in hands for someone who lacks knowledge or is only in it for profit.
