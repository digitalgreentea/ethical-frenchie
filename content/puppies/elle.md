I’m Elle, a 3 month old blue Frenchie girl. I’m very tiny, but as spunky as they come. When people see me they think I’m harmless, but you know what they say…poison comes in small bottles. **My life motto is: Give me food and tell me I’m pretty.**

I love playing with other puppies and am very well socialized. At a young age I was exposed to as many people and situations as possible – so now I’m fearless and ready for my new home.

**Looking for a blue girl to love? Fill out the application ASAP…. I’m so cute I just know I won’t be available much longer. Don’t test your luck.**

I come with all my shots, dewormed since week 2, already on heart worm prevention with a health guarantee and a health certificate.

Available as a pet or FULL AKC.

**Location**: Raleigh, NC
