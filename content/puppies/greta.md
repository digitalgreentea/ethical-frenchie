## I’m Greta, a blue pied French Bulldog.
But here’s the trick. I’m what they call a tea cup French Bulldog puppy. A tea cup French Bulldog puppy is a puppy that stays on the smaller side. I probably won’t exceed 18 lbs when I’m fully grown.

How does that happen you wonder? Well both of my parents are very small French Bulldogs, as were their parents. I’m not what they call a runt..I’m just genetically predisposed to being tiny, that’s all.

Even though I’m small my personality is bigger than you have ever seen. Honestly you should think twice if you can handle all the sass I bring.

If you want to meet me please fill out the application form and my parents will be with you shortly.

Before they let me go I will have my DHHP shot, Bordatella shot, will be dewormed and also microchipped. My parents are nice so they will give you unlimited coaching and instructions as well as a goody bag full of things I love.
