## Hey!
Pickle Rick here.. I’m 10 weeks old and looking for my forever home.

I’m a blue eyed  Frenchie with an attitude. I was the first born in my litter and my mom says I’m definitely an alpha male. I rule the pack. You better follow my rules.

But don’t worry I have a soft side also. I’m super friendly and cuddly. Love attention at all times. My favorite things are: everything bacon related and long walk in nature where I can run and feel free.

I do get along with other dogs, but they better leave me alone when i have a bone. Other than that I’m a healthy boy, dewormed, up to date on shots and come with a health guarantee.

I would love to meet you! Full AKC registration is possible for with an additional fee. If you are interested in me, please fill out the application or come see me in person.

**Location**: Raleigh, NC
