## Hey guys Sketch here!
I’m a blue ( if you want to know how much do blue french bulldog puppies coast – inquire by clicking here) French Bulldog and as my name tells you I find everything sketchy. It takes a minute for me to warm up / get out of my shell and show my true colors, but when I do, I’m the most loving and cuddly little pup.

My motto is: Has big ears, still doesn’t listen, so I’m looking for a partner in crime that can handle that. What makes me different from my brother and sister is the fact that I’m all blue – no white stripe.

I would love for you to come see me and let me decide if I want to adopt you. Yes you heard that right…you don’t adopt a frenchie, the frenchie adopts you. I was born on October 10th and as you can see am growing bigger and more curious everyday.
